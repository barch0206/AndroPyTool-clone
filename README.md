# AndroPyTool-clone
- creating a framework security tool designed for Android app analysis and reverse engineering.
- provides a wide range of features and functionalities to help security researchers and developers to analyse Android apps and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- tool can be used to perform various tasks such as decompiling and recompiling APKs, analysing the app's source code, and identifying security issues such as insecure data storage, insecure network communication, and sensitive information leakage.
- provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to use even for those who are new to Android app security testing.
- provides comprehensive feedback on malware by performing both static as well as dynamic malware and the outputs are stored in easy-to-read formats such as csv/json.
